        <h3>Evaluation of the Uber Mobile App</h3>
        <p>The final assignment of the course Introduction to UX was to choose a product, website or application and evaluate its usefulness, usability, engagement and meaning. I have chosen the application Uber, which purpose is taxi oredering. This chart shows critiquing the app by relevant factors from 0 to 5: 
            </p>
            <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="Uber Evaluation">
  <tr>
    <th> <b>Factor</b> </th>
    <th><b>Rating </b></th>
    <th><b>Explanation</b> </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Usefulness </td>
    <th> 5.0 </th>
    <td>I would give max. rating to Uber mobile app because it totally fulfils its purpose. The product solves the right problem for the user: if you need a taxi, you can order it in this app and it will arrive in a few minutes (unless you are in the middle of nowhere).
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Ease of Use </td>
    <th> 5.0 </th>
    <td>My rating for Uber on the Ease of use factor is 5/5. The application does not offer plenty of functions at one moment so it is easy to find things you are looking for: the main function (ordering the taxi) is suggested to the user right after opening the app. Other functions can be found in the main menu. 
</td>
  </tr>
                <tr>
    <td> Efficiency </td>
    <th> 4.0 </th>
    <td>I would give Uber 4/5 rating on efficiency. It takes not much effort to order the taxi: <br>
•	open the app and change pick up location (if needed)<br>
•	click on the search line to enter the address<br>
•	change the taxi type (if needed) and confirm the order<br>
•	wait for taxi<br>
Thus, the user can achieve his goal in just 3-5 actions which is really fast. However, if the indicated location is remote from any inhabitant locality, it may take time to wait for taxi. What is more, if there are a lot of traffic jams in your city, going by taxi may take more time than by metro/train. 
</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> Safety </td>
    <th> 4.0 </th>
    <td>I would give my product 4/5 rating on this factor. The app is forgiving: users always have an opportunity to cancel their order, but if they do it too late, the app may take some money for the false alarm.  
</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> Flow </td>
    <th> 3.5 </th>
    <td>I would give Uber 3.5/5 rating on Flow factor. The app offers the actions for a user which need to be done to achieve the final goal. A user has control of actions while using the app, because all buttons have clear purpose. However, it is hard to say that the user gets totally concentrated and immersed into the application, because a taxi ordering app does not have to make users forget about their surroundings while using it.
</td>
  </tr>
                <tr>
    <td> Activation </td>
    <th> 4.0 </th>
    <td>My rating for Uber App activation is 4/5: I think the application context is quite attractive for the user so it might make him want to explore it; the app takes the user from one action to the next one, so it is activating, but though it is simple at the beginning, it does not become more complicated and it does not make people feel challenge.
</td>
  </tr>
                <tr>
    <td> Aesthetics </td>
    <th> 3.5 </th>
    <td>I would give Uber App 3.5/5 on aesthetics because the app has its personal style and design and works smoothly, so nothing might irritate users. There are animation models of cars shown on the map around your location. Though colors of the application are mostly black and white, the design looks attractive. However, it does not offer any options to change its design, to choose light/dark version of the app, so it is similar to every user. 
</td>
  </tr>
                <tr>
    <td> Competence </td>
    <th> - </th>
    <td>I think the Uber App makes users feel competent because it gives them the ability to achieve their goal (to order a taxi) successfully and efficiently: the user just needs to point/confirm his location, enter his destination and confirm the order. 
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
            <h4>Conclusions:</h4>
            <p>
            Overall, the Uber App is definitely useful (as it fulfils its purpose), usable (as it is easy, understandable and has all functions that it needs) and meaningful (as it fits the user’s values). Engagement is not so significant for this application, however its factors are enough to satisfy users. According to reviews, in general, people are satisfied with using the Uber App and it means that the app has a good UX design.
